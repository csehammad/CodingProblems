## Challenge#1- Perfix Notation 
#### Write a function that evaluates an expression written in Prefix Notiation and returrns a value 

**Problem Statement: 

Prefix notation (also known as polish notation) is an alternative to the more familier infix notation. 

In infix notation, operators(add,multiply,etc) are written between their operands(number, variables, or sub-expression). 
* In prefix notation, operators are written before their operands
Some examples follow of expression in infix notation and their equivalents in prefix notation. 
In this example the operator is + and its operands are 1 and 2:

```
Infix expression: 1 + 2 
Prefix expression: + 1 2 
Value: 3
```

In this example, the sub-expression + 1 2 is the first operand of the + operator 

```
Infix expression: (1+2) * 3
Prefix expression: * + 1 2 3 
Value: 9 
```
